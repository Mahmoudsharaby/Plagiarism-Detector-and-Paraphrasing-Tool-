The research focuses on Minimum Cost Spanning Trees for Graphs in computer science. It explores the efficient ways to connect a community of nodes and minimize the total weight of edges within a tree. The paper discusses the applications of minimum cost spanning trees in various domains, including network design, parallel and distributed computing, and solving heuristic problems. This research is motivated by the need for reliable communication methods and time optimization in the technologically advanced world. The proposed approach involves utilizing algorithms like Kruskal's and Boruvka's algorithms to find minimum cost-spanning trees. The paper highlights the benefits of minimum cost spanning trees, such as optimizing transportation routes and reducing resource usage in computer networks. It also addresses the use of minimum cost spanning trees in solving heuristic problems, precisely the salesman problem, which requires significant computational time. In addition, parallel and distributed computing offers speedy solutions for large-scale graphs. The research concludes by emphasizing the significance of minimum cost-spanning trees in network design for cost-effective and efficient connectivity.
