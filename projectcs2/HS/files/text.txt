Recent HCI studies have shown bureaucratic traits of algorithmic systems. Rooted in organization science, the notion of bureaucracy refers to rule-governed procedures that are inflexible to adapt. HCI researchers have demonstrated how bureaucracy is embedded in assidous algorithms that support or automate decision-making. For example, on Amazon Mechanical Turk, quality assessment algorithms would not assign new tasks to workers if their past work was not completed as goldstandard solutions in the algorithms training dataset
