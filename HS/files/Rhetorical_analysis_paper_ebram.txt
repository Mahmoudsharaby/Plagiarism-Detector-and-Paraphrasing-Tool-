Maryam Al-Khawaja is a Bahraini human rights activist who won the annual freedom award from the freedom house organization in 2012. She sheds light on what has been occurring in Bahrain, calling for action and participation from the whole world and particularly other human rights activists to eliminate Bahraini struggles with the current rulers. Al-Khawaja presents what happened in the Bahraini revolution, showing how mean the current rulers are, to the extent that they attacked the protestors even though the protest was peaceful. She also explains that the main demands are human-rights based. She communicates the message and presents her claims through a small video that includes photos, background music, and text. The speaker tries to set creditability and appeal to logic and emotions by using language effectively combined with statistics and facts that would support her claims. The intended effects that are achieved are sympathizing with the Bahrani people and supporting the protestors there. Nevertheless, doubts regarding the source of some statistics is one of the unintended effects.
